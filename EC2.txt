1. EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service.

    IaaS: Provides virtualized computing resources over the Internet. It offers the basic infrastructure of virtual servers, networks, operating systems, and storage through a cloud provider. (example: EC2)

    PaaS: Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. (example: Elastic Beanstalk)

    IaaS offers more control to users over the IT resources, whereas PaaS provides a higher level abstraction of these resources to simplify the development process.

2. EC2 service mainly consists in the capability of: 
    a. renting virtual machine(EC2 instance) 
    b. Storing data on virtual drives(EBS)
    c. Distributing load across machines(ELB)
    d. Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group(ASG)

3. Sizing and Config Options
    a. OS: Linux, Windows or Mac OS
    b. How much compute power and cores(CPU)
    c. How much RAM
    d. how much storage:
        1. Network attached(EBS & EFS)
        2. hardware(EC2 instance store)
    e. Network card: speed of the card, Public ip address
    f. Firewall rules: security group. 
    g. Bootstrap script(configure at first launch): EC2 User Data.

4. EC2 User Data
    a. bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts.
    b. That script is only run ONCE at the instance FIRST start.
    c. EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
        1. installing updates.
        2. installing software.
        3. Downloading common files from the internet.
        4. anything you can think of.
    d. EC2 User Data Script runs with the ROOT user(of the instance, not the AWS account). (any command you have there, will have sudo right)
