8. SageMaker
    • Fully managed service for developers / data scientists to build ML models.
    • Typically difficult to do all the processes in one places + provision servers, and this is where SageMaker comes in.

        • actual score in the exam
        • build ML model based on above
        • Train and Tune
        • When new data comes in(years of exp...), apply the model, and get the prediction.


9. Forecast
    • Fully managed service that uses ML to deliver highly accurate forecasts
    • Example: predict the future sales of a raincoat.
    • 50% more accurate than looking at the data itself.
    • Reduce forecasting time from months to hours.

    Use cases:
        1. Historical data: product features, prices, discounts, website traffic... all uploaded to S3
        2. Start a Forecast service on that bucket, and produce a Forecasting model.
        3. use that model to predict future sales of raincoat.


(GPT: The similarity in feeling between SageMaker and Forecast arises from their shared goal of making machine learning accessible and manageable within the AWS ecosystem, leveraging automation and integration. However, the distinction lies in their specialization, with SageMaker offering broad machine learning capabilities and Forecast focusing on time-series forecasting. This specialization allows each service to excel in its respective area, providing tailored tools and processes to best suit the needs of different use cases.)
