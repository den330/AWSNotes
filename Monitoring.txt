AWS Monitoring, Troubleshooting and Audit

Amazon CloudWatch

    • Metrics
        • CloudWatch provices metrics for every service in AWS
        • Metric is a variable to monitor(CPUUtilization, NetworkIn...)
        • Metric belongs to namespaces
        • Dimension is an attribute of a metric(instance id, environment...)
        • Up to 30 dimensions per metric
        • Metrics have timestamps
        • Can create CloudWatch dashboards of metrics.
        • Can create CloudWatch Custom Metrics(for the RAM for example)

    • Streams
        • Continually stream metrics to a destination of your choice, with near-real-time delivery and low latency:
            • Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose(and then its destinations)
            • 3rd party service provider: Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic...

            example: CloudWatch Metric - Stream -> Firehose ->
                        1. S3 -> Athena
                        2. Redshift
                        3. Amazon OpenSearch

        • Option to filter metrics to only stream a subset of them.
