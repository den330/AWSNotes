AWS Monitoring, Troubleshooting and Audit

Amazon CloudWatch

    • Metrics
        • CloudWatch provices metrics for every service in AWS
        • Metric is a variable to monitor(CPUUtilization, NetworkIn...)
        • Metric belongs to namespaces
        • Dimension is an attribute of a metric(instance id, environment...)
        • Up to 30 dimensions per metric
        • Metrics have timestamps
        • Can create CloudWatch dashboards of metrics.
        • Can create CloudWatch Custom Metrics(for the RAM for example)

    • Streams
        • Continually stream metrics to a destination of your choice, with near-real-time delivery and low latency:
            • Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose(and then its destinations)
            • 3rd party service provider: Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic...

            example: CloudWatch Metric - Stream -> Firehose ->
                        1. S3 -> Athena
                        2. Redshift
                        3. Amazon OpenSearch

        • Option to filter metrics to only stream a subset of them.

    • Logs
        • Log Groups: arbitary name, usually representing an application.
        • Log Stream: instances within application / log files / containers.
        • Can define log exp policies(never expire, 1 day to 10 years...)
        • can send logs to:
            • S3(exports)
            • Kinesis Data Stream
            • Kinesis Data Firehose
            • Lambda
            • OpenSearch
        • Logs are encrypted by default.
        • Can setup KMS-based encryption with your own keys.

        Sources
            • SDK, CloudWatch Logs Agent, CloudWatch Unified Agent.
            • Elastic Beanstalk: Collection of logs from application.
            • ECS: collection from containers.
            • AWS Lambda: collection from function logs.
            • VPC Flow Logs: VPC specific logs.
            • API Gateway: logging all the requests sent to it.
            • CloudTrail based on filter
            • Route53: Log DNS Queries

        Logs Insight
            • Search and analyze log data stored in Logs
                • Example: find a specific IP inside a log, count occurrences of "ERROR" in your logs...

            • Provides a purpose-built query language
                • Automatically discovers fields from AWS services and JSON log events
                • Fetch desired event fields, filter based on conditions, calculate aggregate statistics, sort events, limit number of events..
                • Can save queries and add them to CloudWatch dashboards.

            • Can query multiple Log Groups in different AWS accounts.
            • It is a query engine, not a real-time engine.

        S3 Export
            • Log data can take up to 12 hours to become available for export
            • The API call is CreateExportTask
            • Not near-real time or real-time... for that, use Logs Subscriptions instead.

        Logs Subscriptions
            • Get a real-time log events from CloudWatch Logs for processing and analysis.
            • Send to Kinesis DataStreams, Kinesis Data Firehose, or Lambda.
            • Subscription Filter - filter which logs are events delivered to your destination.
            • Logs Aggregation (multi-account and multi-region)
                • Logs from different accounts / regions can be sent to a common destination. 
                • example: Logs from different accounts / regions -> Kinesis Data Stream -> Kinesis Data Firehose -> S3

            • Cross-Account Subscription: send log events to resources in a different AWS accounts(KDS,KDF), see picture: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F4et9lEC7x-VVO4wYCZKasHEKZWg94Us/view?usp=sharing
